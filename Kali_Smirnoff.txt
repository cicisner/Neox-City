Kali Smirnoff was born in Neox City to Linus and Debian Smirnoff. She has two known 
siblings, Ubuntu Smirnoff and Corel Smirnoff. Sources indicate that she has at 
least one more sibling, but they as of yet have been not located. According to 
people who have interacted with her, she began working with magitech at a relatively
young age, learning to manipulate it before eventually learning how to break it at
it's very core so that she could have it do what ever she wanted. Her first known 
exploit proved to be incredibly successful, she managed to siphon untold amounts
of gold from unsuspecting citizens of Neox City. It is unknown what she did with 
the gold, but this is where she began to be known within hacker communities under
the pseudonym BackTrack. Unfortunately, this drew unwanted attention and this 
lead to the disappearance of Corel Smirnoff.From this point forward, less 
activity has been seen by "BackTrack" or Kali. Sources indicate that she 
has left the hacking community all together, but it is unknown if this 
information is correct, or if it is information planted to mislead the current 
whereabouts and status of Kali.  
Her location is currently unknown. The only clue that was given was written by
hand on a note left in her previously known address it read:
"Here's where I am: a16bd29277215cef376ddbba21a2548b <3 Kali"
She was known to have been proficient in cryptography, and her message is as of 
yet, unsolved.
